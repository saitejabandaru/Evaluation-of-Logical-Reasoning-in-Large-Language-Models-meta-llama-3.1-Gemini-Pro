cloning and genetic techniques, humans have been able to \"resurrect\" some already extinct animals, such as mammoths, dodos, dinosaurs, etc.At the same time, the scientific community also started a big discussion about whether humans should revive extinct animals.Supporters believe that reanimated animals are expected to restore the damaged ecological environment in some areas.For example, Mammoths live on the vast grasslands of Siberia, and their excrement is an excellent fertilizer to nourish the grasslands.After the mammoth became extinct, grasslands lacking fertilizer were gradually replaced by tundra.If the mammoth can be resurrected and returned to Siberia, it will help reduce the area of \\u200b\\u200btundra and gradually restore the grassland ecosystem.\\nWhich of the

resurrect the entire population\\nC.Even if the extinct animals can be resurrected in batches, the habitat suitable for their growth may have long since disappeared.If you can not give heavy organisms

has constantly reformed the content of the college entrance examination.The subjects of the college entrance examination were reduced from the original 7 subjects to 4 subjects.However, the difficulty of the exam increased, and the school had to strengthen the students\\' test-taking training.Some provinces and cities have tried to reduce the difficulty of the test a little bit, and as a result, students ’scores have generally improved, and the scores for college admissions have also risen.For college, students must score higher scores.\\nThis shows which of the following can most logically

of all units in City B account for one-fifth of the total number of motor vehicles in this city, which is one of the important factors causing traffic jams in this city.\\nC.After the bus line fare is greatly reduced, the bus will be more crowded, thereby reducing the comfort of riding.\\nD.Cheap fares are not attractive to private car owners who focus on the environment and \"enjoy

Moreover, the crime gave judicial personnel too much \"discretion\" and \"compromise space\".Therefore, the source of huge amounts of property should be treated as corruption and bribery.\\nWhich of the following statements does not support the above argument?\\nA.Corrupt officials know that once their embezzled and bribery property is identified as \"unidentified sources\", the punishment can be reduced; China\\'s existing investigative methods are backward, and confessors may incur more severe punishment than those who do not recognize the account.\\nB.I would like to ask who doesn\\'t know where the property in their family comes from? The crime of huge property of unknown origin is conducive to cracking down on corrupt officials \"from light to light\", but is not conducive to social justice.\\nC.\"Presumption of innocence\" and \"right to silence\" are all basic concepts of modern rule of law.If the accused is not proven guilty, he should be deemed innocent.\\nD.The laws of Singapore, Brunei and India all stipulate that if the source of civil servants ’property is unknown, corruption and bribery should be used.\\n\\nb\\nCross-species studies of animal populations indicate that cubs isolated from their mothers within a month of birth often show strong aggressiveness.For example, when fighting for food and fighting for food, other cubs give up and they are still fighting.The hypothesis explaining this phenomenon is that the formation of aggressive aggression is due to the lack of social training led by the parents at the newborn stage.\\nIf any of the following statements are true, can the above argument be strengthened most effectively?\\nA.The early antelopes isolated from their mothers showed great aggression during the conflict to establish their dominant position in the population.\\nB.Chimpanzees who grew up in the social training environment of their parents were much less aggressive in mating conflicts than chimpanzees who did not grow up in this environment.\\nC.Babies who are adopted in the first three months of life often appear aggressive during childhood.\\nD.Many polar bears are more aggressive in food conflicts than in mating conflicts.\\n\\na\\nThe only way economists distinguish normal products from low-end products is to see how consumers respond to changes in income.If people\\'s income increases, the demand for something becomes smaller, and such a thing is a low-end product.Similarly, if people\\'s incomes decrease, their demand for low-end products will increase.\\nWhich of the following statements best matches the economist ’s description of the difference between normal and low-grade products?\\nA.Poor students in the school often eat instant noodles, and they often go to restaurants after they find a job after graduation.For these students, instant noodles are inferior.\\nB.In family life, as people\\'s incomes decrease, the demand for table salt has not increased.There is no doubt that table salt is a low-grade product.\\nC.In an increasingly aging community, the demand for gasoline is getting smaller and smaller, and the demand for home care services is growing.Compared with gasoline, home care services are inferior.\\nD.When people\\'s income increases, parents will buy a few more brand-name clothes for their children.When income decreases, they will buy less.Brand-name clothing is not a low-end product, nor a normal product, but a high-end product.\\n\\nd\\nEconomist? Now the central government is considering the performance of local governments according to GDP indicators.To increase local GDP, large amounts of capital are required.Under the current system, local governments can only raise a lot of money by transferring land.If you want to auction land at a high price, house prices must be high, so local governments have a strong incentive to push up house prices.However, the central government has introduced a series of measures to stabilize housing prices.If the local government still vigorously pushes up housing prices, it may be punished by the central government.\\nWhich of the following statements is the logical conclusion of the economist ’s argument?\\nA.Under the current system, if the local government lowers housing prices, it will not be punished by the central government.\\nB.Under the current system, if local governments do not pursue GDP performance, they will not vigorously push up housing prices.\\nC.Under the current system, local governments will certainly not reduce housing prices.\\nD.Under the current system, local governments may be punished by the central government or unable to improve their GDP performance.\\n\\na\\nIn recent years, experts have called for a ban on the addition of biphenyl compounds as oxytocin to animal feed, because this substance is harmful to humans.In the past ten years, it has been found that the residues of biphenyls in the feeds of many Dutch dairy cows raised by herders.\\nIf which of the following statements is true, which strongly supports the expert\\'s point of view?\\nA.In the past two years, the incidence of bladder cancer among Dutch dairy cow and dairy consumers has been particularly high.\\nB.Biphenyl residues have been found in the blood and urine of many Dutch cows.\\nC.The incidence of cancer in the dairy production areas of the Netherlands ranks first in the country.\\nD.The infertility rate of Dutch cows is higher than the average of other cows.\\n\\nb\\ntwenty one.This year, China\\'s increasing investment in Africa has caused uneasiness in Western countries, and criticisms such as \"China\\'s plundering of African resources\" are endless.In response, a Chinese official retorted? \"One of the most important grounds for criticism is that China takes oil from Africa, but last year, China exported only 8.7% of all oil exported from Africa, and Europe accounted for 36% of the US 33%.If imports were 8.7 % Are suspected of plundering resources, so how should 36% and 33% look at it? \"\\nAdding the following statement, this official can come to the conclusion that \"China has not plundered African resources\"?\\nA.Europe and the United States are suspected of plundering African resources.\\nB.Europe and the United States did not plunder African resources.\\nC.The demand for raw materials in countries such as China and India has increased the prices of raw materials and brought more income to African countries.\\nD.African countries have the right to decide how to handle their own resources.\\n\\na\\nA chemical plant that produces an insecticide that can make small mammals such as otters infertile.After the factory started to operate, the incidence of infertility of an otter living in a nearby river increased rapidly.Therefore, this factory must have polluted the river water when producing pesticides.\\nWhich of the following statements contains the reasoning errors most similar to the ones above?\\nA.A low-calcium diet can lead to decreased egg production in poultry.After the chickens on a farm were released for food in spring, their egg production decreased significantly.Therefore, the calcium content of the food they find and ingest must be very low.\\nB.The bacteria that cause tetanus survive in the digestive tract of horses.Tetanus is a highly contagious disease.Therefore, horses must be more susceptible to tetanus than most other animals.\\nC.Malnourished animals are easily infected with diseases, and animals in big city zoos are not malnourished.Therefore, they are definitely not easily infected.\\nD.The ape is characterized by a reversed thumb and no tail.Recently, a fossil remnant of an unknown animal has been discovered.Because this animal has a reversible thumb, it must be an ape.\\n\\nb\\nBecause the photo is light, the object is printed on the film.Therefore, in a sense, every photo is true.However, the use of photos to express things is always different from the things themselves.Photos cannot show complete authenticity.In this sense, it is fake.Therefore, just one photo cannot confirm anything.\\nWhich of the following statements is the assumption that led to the above conclusion?\\nA.Complete authenticity is unknowable.\\nB.Anything that cannot show complete authenticity cannot constitute final evidence.\\nC.If there is other evidence indicating the authenticity of the shooting site, you can use the photo as auxiliary evidence.\\nD.The photos of the South China Tiger taken by Zhou cannot be used as evidence of the existence of the South China Tiger in Shaanxi.\\n\\na\\nA family has four cats, one of them steals the fish from his family.The host interrogated them, and only one cat told the truth.The four cats answered as follows?

Perhaps smoking marijuana will indeed lead to heroin, but it is ridiculous to quote the statistics you mentioned to confirm this, because 100% of heroin users have a history of drinking water.\\nIn response to Wang Gang\\'s discussion, which of the following demonstration techniques did Li Yan use?\\nA.Provide an example to show that anything that does not induce the use of heroin is unsafe.\\nB.Question the practice of establishing causality based solely on statistical data.\\nC.Provide evidence that the statistics used by Wang Gang to support his conclusions are inaccurate.\\nD.Show that his argument is flawed by showing that Wang Gang\\'s argument will lead to an obviously wrong conclusion.\\n\\nd\\nA study shows that eating celery helps to suppress aggressive emotions.151 women were surveyed.Of the women who said they often eat celery, 95% said they rarely have aggressive feelings or are irritated.Among women who do not eat celery often, 53% report that they often have anxiety, anger and combative emotions.\\nThe following statements all weaken the conclusions above, except\\nA.Those women who often eat celery pay more attention to fitness, and fitness consumes a lot of physical energy, is very tired, and suppresses the aggressive mood.\\nB.Female interviewees are susceptible to hints and are more willing to cooperate.They will cooperate with researchers intentionally or unintentionally to answer questions in the direction they want.\\nC.Like the effect of placebo, eating celery will suppress the aggressive mood, which stimulated a series of psychological and mental activities of female respondents and made them feel less aggressive.\\nD.Celery has the effects of calming the liver, clearing away heat, removing annoyance and reducing swelling, detoxifying the lungs, strengthening the stomach and blood, lowering blood pressure, and brain sedation.\\n\\nc\\nIt is generally believed that human aesthetic judgment is subjective, and it is indeed the case in a short period of time.People often have big differences in the evaluation of contemporary art works.However, as time goes by, the subjective factors in aesthetics gradually disappear.When a work of art can continue to bring joy and beauty to people for centuries, just like Da Vinci\\'s paintings and Bach\\'s music, we can fairly objectively call it a great work.\\nWhich of the following statements best supports the above statement?\\nA.When Leonardo and Bach were alive, people\\'s evaluation of their works was different.\\nB.It is difficult to make an objective determination of the value of contemporary art works.\\nC.For the same work of art, people\\'s evaluations in different times are very different.\\nD.If critics agree on a contemporary art work, this work is a great work.\\n\\na\\nEven the most diligent people in the world cannot finish all the books in the world.\\nWhich of the following is the logical corollary of the statement above?\\nA.The most diligent people in the world must not be able to read all the books in the world.\\nB.The most diligent people in the world may not be able to read all the books in the world.\\nC.The most diligent person in the world may finish all the books in the world.\\nD.The person who reads all the books in the world must be the most diligent person in the world.\\n\\nb\\nAdvertisement? \"Zhi Lixiao\" is a new type of diet pills, which can effectively help fat people lose weight.In clinical trials, only 6 out of 100 people taking Zhilixiao reported side effects.Therefore, 94% of people have a positive effect after taking Zhilixiao, which is the most effective weight loss drug on the market.\\nWhich of the following statements most appropriately points out the problem with the advertisement?\\nA.The advertisement depreciates other weight loss pills, but does not provide enough evidence that there is unfair competition.\\nB.The advertisement makes a suspicious assumption? if the drug has no side effects, it will have a positive effect on weight loss.\\nC.When the advertisement proves the weight loss effect of Zhilixiao, the sample data provided is too small to be representative.\\nD.Moving flowers, exaggerating, false propaganda, this is a common problem of all advertisements, and this advertisement is no exception.\\n\\nb\\nMost excellent athletes have good psychological qualities.Most excellent athletes have achieved good results in the competition, and all athletes who have achieved good results in the competition are trained hard.\\nWhich of the following statements can be appropriately derived from the above statement?\\nA.Most hard-working athletes have good psychological qualities.\\nB.Some athletes with good psychological qualities are trained hard.\\nC.All excellent athletes are trained hard.\\nD.Some athletes who do not have good psychological quality have achieved good results in the competition.\\n\\nb\\nThe People\\'s Bank of China announced that from July 20, 2013, the interest rate control of financial institutions\\' loans will be fully liberalized.However, only by liberalizing the upper limit of deposit interest rates can we truly realize the marketization of interest rates.If the government does not voluntarily give up its own power, market forces will be difficult to play a role.Once the upper limit of deposit interest rates is lifted, interest rate wars will begin between banks, leading to increased financial risks.If financial risks rise, a deposit insurance system needs to be established.\\nIf the above statement is true, which of the following statements must be true?\\nA.With the deepening of reform, sooner or later China will truly realize the marketization of interest rates.\\nB.Only by establishing a deposit insurance system can China truly realize the marketization of interest rates.\\nC.As long as the government voluntarily gives up its own power, market forces can play a role.\\nD.As long as the deposit insurance system is established, financial risks can be effectively avoided.\\n\\nb\\nWhen scientists cloned a certain housefly, they changed a single gene of the housefly.The housefly thus cloned did not have ultraviolet vision because they lacked the eye cells that make the housefly have ultraviolet vision.At the same time, Musca domestica cloned in a conventional manner (without gene modification) has normal vision.Scientists have thus shown that this housefly without UV vision must have some kind of defect or damage in this gene.\\nWhich of the following statements is the hypothesis required for this argument?\\nA.Scientists have a good understanding of the relationship between the housefly\\'s genes and their vision.\\nB.This housefly does not need other genes when generating UV vision cells.\\nC.All types of house flies have ultraviolet vision.\\nD.Except for the lack of UV vision cells, changing this gene has no other effect on house flies.\\n\\nd\\nEvery evil has a reason, but all evil has no excuse.I ca n’t be obliged to be evil because the evil comes from above; I ca n’t be qualified to be evil because everyone else is so evil? I ca n’t even be evil because someone is evil to myself.Therefore, every specific evil must be condemned.If respect for life must be specific to single digits, then the condemnation of sin must also be specific to single digits.\\nThe following statements conflict with the ideas expressed above, except\\nA.Chen Shui made the Xiamen bus arson case.Although it is unreasonable, it is justifiable? He is a weak person in the society and has been treated unfairly by many people ...\\nB.A Nazi officer poisoned hundreds of Jews in a concentration camp.He was carrying out the orders of his superiors.\\nC.During the Cultural Revolution, Huang Xiaomeng at the university criticized their university professors and beat one of them into disability.At that time, the whole of China was crazy.He was just wrapped in this kind of madness.Besides, he was too young ...\\nD.No life can be harmed innocently, even if you hold high the banner of justice.\\n\\na\\nThe sun about 2 billion years ago was 30% darker than the current sun.If the current sun is as dim as the sun at that time, the ocean on earth will completely freeze into ice.However, there is fossil evidence that as early as 3.8 billion years ago, liquid water and life existed on Earth.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one is most helpful to eliminate the obvious inconsistencies in the above description?\\nA.3.8 billion years ago, the earth ’s atmosphere could retain significantly more heat than the current atmosphere.\\nB.The liquid water that appeared on the earth 3.8 billion years ago later froze again, and only re-melted about 2 billion years ago.\\nC.About 2 billion years ago, a powerful heat source that did not come from the sun melted large chunks of ice on the earth.\\nD.There is evidence that certain areas of the ocean have been frozen until a period later than 2 billion years ago.\\n\\na\\nExperts? The board of directors of a listed company is usually composed of large shareholders.Small shareholders cannot enter the board of directors because of their small equity, so the interests of small shareholders are easily violated by large shareholders.The establishment of an independent director system is to hope that independent directors can represent minority shareholders and form checks and balances against major shareholders.However, independent directors are hired and paid by the company\\'s board of directors, which forms an economic “alliance” relationship between the independent directors and the company\\'s board of directors, making it difficult for independent directors to exercise their power as independent shareholders.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one most strongly supports the above expert\\'s conclusion?\\nA.If independent directors challenge the company\\'s board of directors to protect the interests of minority shareholders, the result is often dismissed by the company\\'s board of directors.\\nB.Some independent directors dare to protect the interests of minority shareholders, despite the great pressure.\\nC.At present, the independent director system of Chinese listed companies is not yet perfect.\\nD.Many retired senior officials have served as independent directors of Chinese listed companies.\\n\\nc\\nMany people think that online dating is not reliable.A research team from the University of Chicago conducted an online survey of 19,000 Americans who married between 2005 and 2012 and found that more than a third of them met their spouses through dating sites or social networks such as Facebook; these respondents The overall divorce rate is much lower than the average divorce rate.This survey shows that online dating is very reliable in achieving a stable marriage.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one most strongly challenges the above conclusion?\\nA.People who still follow the traditional offline dating method are either very old or very young.\\nB.The funder behind the study is a dating site.\\nC.The respondents\\' marriage time is relatively short.\\nD.Compared with online dating, work contact, friend introduction, and attending the same school are more common ways to find a spouse.\\n\\na\\nWhen the local government auctions land, it has a basic price, which is called the “land base price”; the ratio of the amount of money that exceeds the base price of the land to the base price of the land is called the “premium rate”.The level of the premium rate marks the popularity of the land and property markets.City B has a piece of land.During the first listing this year, it was temporarily suspended because the premium rate will reach a new high.The second listing ended with a premium rate lower than the first listing, but the total amount of transactions exceeded the amount that the first listing might reach.\\nIf the following statement is true, which item best explains the seemingly inconsistent phenomenon?\\nWhen the land in City A.B was listed for the second time, the government raised its base price.\\nB.This year, City B has implemented the strictest real estate regulation and control policies in the country.\\nC.At present, the income from land auction is an important financial source for local governments.\\nWhen the land in City D.B was listed for the second time, the level of competition among developers was far more intense than the first.\\n\\nb\\nRecently, Fonterra Dairy Group of New Zealand reported to the government that one of its raw material samples contained botulinum.In fact, New Zealand and China do not include botulinum in milk powder testing projects, and there are no reports of pathogenic products.Fonterra\\'s exposure of its ugliness may be due to the moral conscience of the company, or it may be concerned about punishment, because in New Zealand, if the company cannot deal with food safety issues in time, it will be severely punished.This shows that Fonterra\\'s self-exposure is not really out of moral conscience.\\nWhich of the following reasoning has the same logical error as the above reasoning?\\nA.Fish and bear paws can\\'t have both.\\nB.The offender is either A or B.It has been found that the perpetrator is A.so the perpetrator is not B.\\nC.If one is immersed in worldly life, one cannot become a philosopher.Therefore, if you want to be a philosopher, you should give up the lifestyle of ordinary people.\\nD.Food and clothing are enough to know honor and shame.\\n\\nd\\nDuring the Second World War, the US and British Air Forces carried out a large bombing of Germany, and they also suffered heavy losses.Experts found that all returned planes were covered with bullet marks on the belly, but the wings were intact.They inferred from this that the belly of the aircraft was very vulnerable to artillery fire, and that the belly protection should be improved.It was later confirmed that these experts were affected by the \"survivor deviation\" when inferred, because the actual situation is that all the aircraft that were hit on the wing fell, and most of the aircraft that were only hit on the belly of the aircraft returned.\\nThe following statements all have similar \"survivor bias\" except\\nA.Beauty and handsome guys have a great advantage in the competition in the workplace.They are easy to get high-paying positions.\\nB.It is easy to succeed when you drop out and start a business during college, for example, Bill Gates.\\nC.Smoking may be beneficial to health and longevity.For example, Deng Xiaoping and Huang Yongyu are both old smokers, but they all live long.\\nD.In a random sampling survey with a sufficiently large sample, it was found that in China, the most popular TV program is \"news broadcasting\".\\n\\nc\\nMy running ability has never been very strong, but since using X brand running shoes, my running performance has improved significantly.Now I can run faster and farther, and my muscles are less sore after running.\"Runner\" magazine also said that X brand running shoes are the best-selling on the market.Therefore, anyone who wants to improve their running performance should buy X brand running shoes.\\nFrom the above, it is possible to draw a conclusion more reasonable than the conclusion drawn by \"I\", except\\nA.Anyone who does not buy X-brand running shoes is someone who does not want to improve running performance.\\nB.Runners similar to \"I\" should buy X-brand running shoes.\\nC.If you buy X brand running shoes, it will make you run faster and farther.\\nD.If the runner is not satisfied with the current running shoes, he is advised to buy X brand running shoes.\\n\\nd\\nScientists? It has been proved that the adoption of new farming methods can enable some well-managed farms to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotics without significantly reducing production or even increasing production.Critics? Not really.The farm you choose is the one most likely to succeed using these new methods.Why not mention those farms that tried new methods but failed in the end?\\nWhich of the following statements best evaluates the critics\\' rebuttal?\\nA.Critics believe that the new farming methods should be able to be generalized.\\nB.Critics have shown that if the number of farms under study is greatly increased, different results will be obtained.\\nC.Critics assume for no reason that some farm failures are not caused by their soil quality.\\nD.The critic\\'s rebuttal is wrong, because the scientist aims to show that a certain situation may occur, which has nothing to do with whether the research object is representative.\\n\\nc\\nCritics? As the practice of electronic monitoring of employees becomes more and more common, and thus personal privacy is becoming more intrusive, I have heard more and more defenses from employers on this practice.They explained that monitoring is to keep employees honest, efficient and courteous to customers.I think that this explanation is obviously for the employers themselves, and it simply cannot show that the unreasonable violation of personal privacy is justified.\\nWhich of the following most appropriately points out a flaw in the critic\\'s argument?\\nA.Attack an argument that is different from the argument actually put forward by the employer.\\nB.Assume that employees will never be dishonest, inefficient, or impolite to customers.\\nC.Attack employers ’motives rather than refute their defenses.\\nD.Summarized based on a biased sample\\n\\nb\\nNo computer can do everything the human brain can do, because some problems cannot be solved by running any mechanical program.Computers can only solve problems by running mechanical programs.\\nWhich of the following statements is the assumption that the above discussion relies on?\\nA.There is at least one problem that can be solved by running a mechanical program, but it cannot be solved by anyone\\'s brain.\\nB.There is at least one problem.It cannot be solved by running any mechanical program, but it can be solved by at least one person\\'s brain.\\nC.There is at least one problem that can be solved by running any mechanical program, but cannot be solved by anyone\\'s brain.\\nD.Every problem can be solved by everyone\\'s brain if it can be solved by running at least one mechanical program.\\n\\nb\\nIn the novel \"Article 22 Military Regulations\" of the American writer Joseph Heller, Article 22 Military Regulations stipulates that only when a soldier\\'s mental status is abnormal and he applies for suspension of flight, can he be allowed to stop flying.According to common sense, if a soldier is aware of the danger of flying and submits an application to stop flying, it shows that his mind is clear and his spirit cannot be abnormal.\\nWhich of the following statements is the logical inference above?\\nA.If a person is mentally abnormal, he will be allowed to stop flying.\\nB.No one can be allowed to stop flying.\\nC.If a person can realize that there is a danger of flying, it shows that he is mentally normal.\\nD.If a person can file an application to stop flying, it shows that his spirit cannot be abnormal.\\n\\nd\\nJudges in some states of the United States are elected.Elections usually require financial support from interest groups, which may directly or indirectly affect judicial justice.A study showed that in cases where the party involved was its own campaign sponsor, 65% of the judges of the Supreme Court of Louisiana supported the campaign sponsor.This shows that there is a correlation between the campaign funding granted to the judge and the judgment in favor of the sponsor.\\nWhich of the following statements best points out the problems in the above argument?\\nA.The argument improperly presupposes that in a case where the party involved is a campaign sponsor, the proportion of judgments supporting the sponsor should not exceed 50%.\\nB.The argument failed to explain the impact of the amount of campaign funding on the judgment.\\nC.The argument ignores the fact that under the circumstances that campaign funding and judicial decisions are completely transparent, the media\\'s supervision of justice is everywhere.\\nD.The argument does not give the proportion of campaign sponsors among all involved parties.\\n\\na\\nThe concepts of physics are usually very standardized and rigorous.The physical quantities represented by physics terms have clear definitions, measurement methods and conversion relationships.For dark energy, physicists and cosmologists still know nothing about it.\"Dark energy\" refers to the most profound problem in current cosmology.\\nWhich of the following statements is most appropriate to continue the above as its conclusion?\\nA.\"Dark energy\" is obviously not a clear physics concept.\\nB.Scientists use \"dark energy\" to name a cosmic puzzle is helpless.\\nC.\"Dark energy\" refers to the confusing phenomenon that the previously discovered universe is accelerating expansion.\\nD.Scientists still do not know the deep connotation behind the term \"dark energy\".\\n\\na\\nTraditional memory theory believes that memory is like a videotape, and each recollection is to find a certain video in the corresponding time from the brain and play it back.Scene construction theory gives another explanation for memory?

When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming\\'s rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?\\nA.After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.\\nB.Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.\\nC.Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.\\nD.During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.\\n\\nb\\nGenetic testing of the fetus is morally wrong.People have no right to kill a potential living organism simply because it does not accept the sex of a potential living organism, or because it has a certain physiological defect.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one provides the strongest support for the above statement?\\nA.If the baby\\'s sex is allowed to be selected in advance, it will cause the imbalance of the sex ratio of the next generation and cause serious social problems.\\nB.All human beings are created equal, whether male or female, or whether their body is defective.\\nC.People with physical disabilities can also make great contributions.For example, Hawking\\'s physical condition is terrible, but he is known as contemporary Einstein.\\nD.Women can also achieve excellent results and win the respect of society.\\n\\nc\\nStatistics show that those who perpetually practice Tai Chi have the same average life expectancy as those who never practice Tai Chi.This shows that Tai Chi can\\'t strengthen your body and prolong life.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one can weaken the above argument most powerfully?\\nA.Some athletes are physically strong, but their life expectancy is lower than that of ordinary people.\\nB.Tai Chi movement is gentle and soothing, persevering all year round, it can relieve muscles and promote blood circulation, nourish qi and calm the mind.\\nC.Among those who insist on playing Tai Chi all the year round, there are many frail and sick people.\\nD.Tai Chi exercise is easy to develop, and there are no requirements for the venue and the physical fitness of athletes.\\n\\na\\nThere are 6 warehouses in a warehouse, in order from 1 to 6.There are 6 kinds of goods F, G, L, M, P, T.Each warehouse stores exactly one of 6 kinds of goods, and different kinds of goods cannot be stored in the same warehouse.The following conditions must also be met when storing goods?

either there is a Christian God, or not.Assuming you believe in the existence of God and live in a Christian way, then if God does exist, you will receive endless well-being? if God does not exist, you will lose very little.However, suppose you do not believe in the existence of God and do not live in a Christian way.If God does not exist, you will not lose anything? if God does exist, you will be endlessly punished.So, don\\'t hesitate anymore, choose to believe in the existence of God and live in a Christian way.\\nWhich of the following best illustrates the logical loophole of this argument?\\nA.The argument incorrectly presupposes that a person can choose whether to believe or not to believe in God at will.\\nB.Pascal changed the faith and turned it into a question about self-interest calculation.\\nC.If God does not exist, we choose to believe in God, which will lead us to misunderstand the world and spend our lives in a confusing way.\\nD.There are many religions in this world, and each religion has a god with unlimited power (God).They will impose unlimited punishment on those who do not believe in themselves.\\n\\nb\\nPoliticians \"economists who claimed that consumer prices rose by less than 3% last year were wrong.Obviously, they haven\\'t bought anything at all recently.Gasoline prices have risen by 10% last year.The cost of my ride went up by 12%.The newspaper went up by 15%.The detergent went up by 15%.The bread went up by 50%.\"\\nThe above argument by politicians is most vulnerable to criticism because\\nA.It accuses the morality of economists, not to refute their arguments.\\nB.It uses a small sample that is not representative as evidence.\\nC.It tries to achieve the purpose of persuasion by resorting to feelings.\\nD.It incorrectly shows that the economists mentioned are not experts in the field of consumer prices.\\n\\nc\\nThe unsophisticated mobile fraud messages like \"X X Group held the anniversary celebration, your mobile phone number won the 100,000 yuan prize\", even after being exposed by the media, it still appears repeatedly.Professional scammers prefer to use low-quality scam messages instead of designing more deceptive and more foolish text messages, which only shows that the scammers are too stupid and too undedicated.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one strongly refutes the above conclusion?-\\nA.The liar must be smart, otherwise it is impossible to deceive others.\\nB.When a scammer swindles, he will find ways to avoid the police ’s attention.\\nC.If a scam has no effect, the scammer has eliminated it.\\nD.Scammers use such text messages to \"catch\" people who might be fooled.They want to filter out smart people from the beginning.\\n\\nb\\nConsider three numbers?

The closure of this nuclear power plant was a victory for the anti-nuclear cause, and it showed that the nuclear industry departments were very late to recognize the fact that they could not safely operate nuclear power plants.Nuclear power plant manager? It does not indicate such a fact.The availability of direct electricity from non-nuclear resources, coupled with mandatory safety inspections and safe maintenance, makes it uneconomical to continue operating this nuclear power plant.Therefore, the shutdown of this nuclear power plant is not for safety reasons, but for economic reasons.\\nThe manager ’s argument is flawed because\\nA.It does not recognize that the power company may now believe that the nuclear power plant is unsafe, even if the shutdown of the nuclear power plant is not for safety reasons.\\nB.It regards the cost increase caused by taking safety precautions as a pure economic factor.\\nC.It ignores the possibility that the resources from which cheap electricity can be obtained may also have safety issues.\\nD.It

incidence of birth defects in the city has doubled.It can be seen that the abolition of the mandatory pre-marital inspection system has led to an increase in the rate of birth defects in newborns.\\nThe answers to the following questions are relevant to the evaluation of the above argument, except\\nA.Has the city\\'s living environment (air and water quality, etc.) been damaged in the past decade?\\nB.Have unhealthy lifestyles such as staying up late and online for a long time among the population of child-bearing age in this city increased significantly?\\nC.Has women in this

non-musicians.Compared with adult non-musicians, adult musicians who started training at about 7 years old, the difference in corpus callosum in volume is particularly obvious.Therefore, music training, especially music training from an early age, can cause some changes in brain structure.\\nWhich of the following is the assumption that the above argument relies on?\\nA.Before the musicians start training, their corpus callosum is not larger than that of non-musicians of the same age.\\nB.Music training conducted late in life will not cause structural changes in the brain.\\nC.For any

which one best explains the strange phenomenon of insurance companies competing for strong insurance business?\\nA.In 2011, 3 of the 36 companies undertaking compulsory insurance were profitable in this type of insurance.\\nB.In the payment of compulsory insurance, some vehicles are paid too much, and some cases that should not be paid are awarded.\\nC.Tractors enjoy the agricultural benefit

milk powder have been in a two-year comparative advertising campaign, accusing each other\\'s products of causing harmful effects on the baby\\'s health.However, these advertising campaigns did not increase their respective market shares, but instead made many people no longer buy any brand of domestically produced milk powder.\\nWhich of the following conclusions strongly supports the above statement?\\nA.Comparative advertising should not be used in an expanding or potentially expanding market.\\nB.Comparative advertising runs the risk of shrinking their target market instead of expanding.\\nC.Comparative advertising will not produce any long-term benefits unless consumers can easily judge the accuracy of those ads.\\nD.If a company ’s products are significantly higher in

which one strongly questioned the expert\\'s interpretation?\\nA.Delaying the retirement age will be opposed by people working in private enterprises.\\nB.Only by stimulating economic development can the unemployment rate be radically reduced.\\nC.The pension gap stems from the unreasonable design of China\\'s pension system.\\nD.The expert\\'s explanation is based on the unproven assumption that

official said, \"If the EU imposes restrictions on Chinese photovoltaic products, it will lift stones and hit its feet.\"\\nIf the following statement is true, which one will give the strongest support to Chinese officials\\' assertions?\\nA.China\\'s photovoltaic industry purchases a lot of raw materials and equipment from Europe, which has driven the development of a large number of photovoltaic upstream and downstream companies in the EU.\\nB.If the European Union keeps high-quality and low-priced Chinese photovoltaic products out of the door, European solar consumers will pay

rate in other states 1.5 times.It can be seen that strict gun control does not help reduce violent crime.\\nIf the following statement is true, which one weakens the above argument the strongest?\\nA.Since 1986, the proportion of American households with guns has declined significantly.\\nB.Since 1986, the annual number of violent crimes in these states that have imposed strict gun control has continued to decline.\\nC.In states that enforce strict gun control laws, few people violate this law.\\nD.The criminologist compared the results of various investigations and found no obvious correlation between the number of privately owned guns and gun violence.\\n\\nc\\nWith the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, in order to attract consumers, a supermarket launched a

customers who make a purchase of more than 500 yuan at a time during the event usually make purchases higher than 500 yuan.\\nC.In the promotional activities, most people who make a purchase of more than 500 yuan at a time are long-term customers of this supermarket.They increase the amount of a single purchase, but reduce the number of purchases.\\nD.Customers who are attracted to shopping in the supermarket by the promotion may not come again after the event.\\n\\na\\nNutritionist?

In the 18th century, a paper on motion is absolute asserted that the change of an object\\'s position over time can be measured without reference to the position of any other object.However, a well-respected physicist claimed that this paper is incoherent.Since an incoherent paper cannot be regarded as a description of reality, movement cannot be absolute.\\nWhich of the following methods or techniques of argument does the philosopher use in his argument?\\nA.Use professional terminology to convince others.\\nB.Rely on the authority of an expert to support a premise.\\nC.It is reasonable to use experimental results to illustrate the mentioned changes in location.\\nD.It is observed that something is a certain condition under experimental conditions, and it is also the case in any case when it is pushed out.\\n\\nc\\nCompared with international oil prices, domestic oil prices have always been \"rising fast and falling slowly\".One of the reasons is that China\\'s refined oil price adjustment is based on the boundary condition that crude oil prices in the three places change by more than 4%.For example, when the price rises from US $ 100 to US $ 104, we will increase the price accordingly; however, if we return from US $ 104 by 4% and then reduce the price, we will have to wait for the price to fall back to US $ 99.84.\\nWhich of the following statements best points out the shortcomings of the above argument?\\nA.The above argument fails to explain that the unreasonable domestic oil prices are caused by various reasons.\\nB.The above argument fails to explain that the root cause of unreasonable domestic oil prices lies in industry monopoly.\\nC.The above argument fails to explain that with 4% as the boundary condition, the higher the oil price, the slower the domestic response.\\nD.The above argument does not start from the same price base point for comparison.If the base point of the price increase is US $ 100, the conditional analysis of the price reduction should also be based on US $ 100.\\n\\na\\nIn a certain class, L classmate is shorter than X classmate, Y classmate is shorter than L classmate, but M classmate is shorter than Y classmate, so Y classmate is shorter than J classmate.\\nWhich of the following statement premises must be added to launch the above statement logically?\\nA.Class J is taller than Class L.\\nB.X is taller than J.\\nC.Class L is taller than Class J.\\nD.J is taller than M.\\n\\nc\\nA theater plans to perform 7 repertoires in the 7 weeks of the fall, they are F, G., J, K, O, R, S.One repertoire is performed every week, and each repertoire is exactly one week.The repertoire must meet the following conditions?
